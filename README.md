# Supervised Machine Learning to recognise handwritten numbers

Description:
Bootcamp Project using supervised machine learning to recognise handwritten numbers using the MNIST dataset.

Installation:
This project will require the user to have Jupyter Notebook installed as well as the mnist_test.csv and mnist_train.csv in the same directory as the MNIST dataset supervised learning.ipynb file.  
The csv files can be obtained from Kaggle from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv.
The user can then open the ipynb file in juptyer notebook.

Usage:
Run each section of the code in Jupyter Notebook in order to see the output of the data and visualizations.
